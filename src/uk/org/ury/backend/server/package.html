    <P>The URY Server kernel.</P>
    <P>The URY Server provides high-level access to the assets 
    (database, files and sound playback) available on the computer 
    systems of a radio station, exposing an intuitive application 
    programming interface using standard formats.</P>
    <P>The server kernel consists of an Apache HttpCore-based HTTP 
    server implementation, which serves the high-level interface 
    to the server, code for managing the external modules that make 
    up the URY backend, and a common provider of objects useful to 
    server-level modules.</P>
    <P>Though designed and built to replace the systems in place 
    at University Radio York, it is hoped that the URY Server will 
    be of use
